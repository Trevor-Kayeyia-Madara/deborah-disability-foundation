              THE STORY OF DEBORAH ATOLWA OMIA  <br />
              (75 YEARS OLD)
            </h1>
            <p>
              Deborah had been ailing for some time following arthritis that had taken a toll on her.
            </p>
            <p>
              After numerous consultations with her doctor in Eldoret, it was agreed that she gets a hip replacement as the existing one was completely destroyed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first left hip replacement surgery was carried out in August 2018. Though with some long stay in the hospital including 3 days in ICU; Deborah came out a victor and was able to go about her usual duties comfortably. The hospital stay accrued a bill of Ksh.528, 057 which was not easy to come by for the family including patient care which included a walking frame and a special toilet to support her, medications and physiotherapy sessions which were necessary to ensure Deborah regains her mobility. This also came at an extra cost to the family.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two years later, the right leg developed similar problems and in Oct 2020, the same doctor in Eldoret recommended a right hip replacement surgery which was done but unfortunately did not go well. Deborah experienced unusually excruciating pain which later followed with swelling at the operated area. She was taken back to the hospital and the surgery redone but still did not resolve.
            </p>
            <p>
              Things became even worse and Mama Deborah was airlifted to a private hospital in Nairobi on 16th Oct 2020, where she was stabilized and management commenced immediately. She went into a state of hypoglycemia, developed kidney insufficiency which necessitated Dialysis and a Septic wound. Management involved major theatre operations involving around 3 debridement sessions, vacuum drainage, and ICU stays followed by one month stay in HDU.
            </p>
            <p>
              She underwent close to 4 theatre operations at the hospital bringing the medical bill close to Ksh.4.3M. This came in as the heaviest burden to the family not forgetting the 2 weekly physiotherapy sessions, 2 weekly nursing and dressing reviews, orthopedic mattress, walking frame, wheelchair, special toilet chair, and general nursing care and medications.
            </p>
            <p>
              In total, Deborah stayed in the hospital for 2 months being discharged on 15th Dec 2020 with monthly reviews until full recovery though not able to walk without the support of a wheelchair or walking frame. Though a painful journey for her, Deborah is alive, fighting it every day with a smile and willing to support those who have been through similar or even worse scenarios to have access to what she struggled to afford then.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was such an expensive journey for her, especially the home-based care which required some medical equipment to facilitate her recovery which was quite time-consuming. We thank God for restoring her health, even though not fully self-reliant but the gift of life is worth celebrating. She would love to put a smile on someoneâ€™s face.
